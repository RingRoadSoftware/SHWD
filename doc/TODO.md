# TODO LIST

## index page
* Add Categories and Cart and Checkout to header
* Add fake social links
* Add footer with Contact Us, About Us, Jobs, etc. pages
* Probably rework front page to read the product links from the database so its dynamic and we just have to update the database to change what products you see

# other pages
* make a checkout.html, category pages probably, supplementary pages like about us etc.
